# Welcome
Hi!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Bo Li. I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in the joint program between [Queen Mary University of London (United Kingdom)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk) and [Northwestern Polytechnical University (China)](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn). I am from the Materials Science background and hope to utilize machine learning for data-driven materials, aiming to give instructions for new materials discovery and reduce the cost of traditional research.

# Research interests
My research focuses on the inverse design of materials via generative models and AI agent (LLMs bind with external materials' tools) for autonomous plantform.
