# Welcome
Hi!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Bo Li, a four-year undergraduate student in the joint program between Queen Mary University of London (United Kingdom) and Northwestern Polytechnical University (China). I am from the Materials Science background and hope to utilize machine learning for data-driven materials, aiming to give instructions for new materials discovery and reduce the cost for traditional research.

# Research interests
My research foucus on the inverse design of the materials via generative models and AI agent (LLMs binded with external materials' tools) for autonomous plantform.
