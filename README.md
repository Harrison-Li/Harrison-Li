# Welcome
Hi!ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Bo Li. I am now a graduate student, and I am from the Materials Science background, hoping to utilize machine learning to accelerate materials design, especially for inverse design of materials and Large Language Models for automated labs to reduce the cost of traditional research.

# Research interests
My research interests focus on the inverse design of materials through **generative models** and the development of **autonomous platforms**.\
