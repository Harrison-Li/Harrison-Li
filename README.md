# Welcome
Hi!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Bo Li. I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in the joint program between <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk">Queen Mary University of London (United Kingdom)</a> and [Northwestern Polytechnical University (China)](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn). I am from the Materials Science background and hope to utilize machine learning for data-driven materials, aiming to give instructions for new materials discovery and reduce the cost of traditional research.

# Research interests
My research foucus on the inverse design of the materials via generative models and AI agent (LLMs binded with external materials' tools) for autonomous plantform.
