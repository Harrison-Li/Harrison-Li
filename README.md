# Welcome
Hi!ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Bo Li. I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in the joint program between [Queen Mary University of London (United Kingdom)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk) and [Northwestern Polytechnical University (China)](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn). I am from the Materials Science background and hope to utilize machine learning for data-driven materials design, especially in inverse design of materials and Large Language Models for automated labs to reduce the cost of traditional research.

# Research interests
My research interests focus on the inverse design of materials through generative models and the development of autonomous platforms.\
